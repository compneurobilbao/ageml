# Contributing to AgeModelling

---
This guide shows the guidelines to contribute to this project.

<!-- TODO: Explain which is our commit, merge, push, etc. philosophy (Good-to-knows) -->

## Project Structure

The project structure is composed by files which are tracked or ignored by git. Usually only code-related files are
tracked, while big files, such as images or binaries, should be avoided.

## Developer Setup

This section explains how to set up a local development environment for contributing to the project.

Another section will be added in the future explaining how to setup a Docker container for development.

### 1. Prepare and set up the package

Poetry is our environment manager and build system. To install the required packages for creating the environment with poetry.

__Note__: If you are using Mac OS, make sure you are installing `pip` correctly, either by installing python3 via homebrew, or other tested methods.

```bash
pip install poetry nox nox-poetry
```

If you want the virtual environment of the project to be located in the project root, run this line (make sure you have poetry installed running `poetry --version`):

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

### 2. Clone the git repository

Run in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/compneurobilbao/ageml.git && cd ageml
```

Once inside the cloned folder (where the _pyproject.toml_ file is located), Poetry will install in the virtual environment (in developer mode) when running:

```bash
poetry install
```

Refer to the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for more information.

### 3. Activate the environment

At this point, a virtual environment should have been created automatically with all the required dependencies.
If this is something that could be launched somehow, activate the poetry shell:

```(bash)
poetry shell
```

Or you can also run:

```(bash)
. <path_to_your_virtual_env>/bin/activate
```

### Running the tests

Before pushing anything with significant changes in code/functionality, tests should be (ideally) run locally. This can be done using pre-commit hooks, or manually.
To run the tests manually, first activate the environment, and then run:

```(bash)
nox -s test
```

For linting:

```(bash)
nox -s lint
```

For coverage:

```(bash)
nox -s coverage
```

### Commits

We try to follow the [__seven rules of a great Git commit message__](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

We like using the following standard prefixes for commit messages. Rigidness is not of our liking, so as long as the commit message is informative about its changes, you are good to go.

- `BUG:` *Fix for runtime crash or incorrect result*
- `DOC:` *Documentation change*
- `ENH:` *New functionality*
- `PERF:` *Performance improvement*
- `REF:` *Only refactoring -> moving classes, files, splitting functions*
- `TST:` *Adding/improving testing of existing functions*
- `STYLE:` *No logic impact (indentation, comments, variable names)*
- `WIP:` *Work In Progress not ready for merge*
- `GIT:` *Modify some repository settings (gitignore, gitmodules, others)*
- `DEL:` *Deleted files, functions, classes, resources and so on*
- `CI:` *Changes in the the CI/CD Pipelines*

### Coding Style Guide

We try following the [PEP-8 Standard](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and we use [Flake-8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting the code.
